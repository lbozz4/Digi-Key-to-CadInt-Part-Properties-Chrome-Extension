# Digi-Key-to-CadInt-Part-Properties-Chrome-Extension
 Scrapes the part number, description, etc. off a Digi-Key part listing and creates an XML file that can be imported into a new CadInt part.

You: Wow, I love CADInt! How do I use this?

Me: Load the unpacked extension by going to chrome://extensions and enabling developer mode. Click the extension icon while on a Digi-Key part page (like this: https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/stmicroelectronics/TS555IDTTR/497-16404-2-ND/5959807) and choose where to download the resulting XML file!


to-do:
- Add a badge to the browserAction to add a green check mark to the icon when you're on a digikey product page
- Use the omnibox to perform some kind of part search that includes the usual criteria (in stock, qty 1, RoHS, etc)
